# PTSD Research Tool

A full-stack web platform combined with a CNN-based classification model for analyzing microglia cell images in PTSD research.

## üîç Project Overview

This project combines two main parts:

- **Deep Learning Model** (SimpleCNN):
  - A trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model for classifying individual microglia cells based on their activation status.
  - The model was trained on crops (cell images) extracted via YOLO-based segmentation.
  - Final validation accuracy: ~80.8%

- **Web Application** (Frontend + Backend):
  - Allows researchers to upload datasets of microglia cell images.
  - View past uploaded datasets and results.
  - Export analysis results.
  
In future stages, the web backend will communicate with the trained model's REST API to perform real-time predictions and return JSON results.

## üì¢ Main Features

### Deep Learning Model
- **Model Architecture**: 2 Convolutional layers + fully connected classifier.
- **Data Augmentation**: Random cropping, flipping, color jittering.
- **Training**: Early stopping and best model saving.
- **Classification Output**: 4 classes of microglia activation stages.

### Web Application
- **Upload New Dataset**: Upload new images, categorized by group (control/experiment).
- **View Past Results**: Browse previously analyzed datasets.
- **Export Analysis Results**: Download a report of the dataset analysis.

## üìä Model Performance
- **Validation Accuracy**: ~80.82%
- **Test Accuracy**: ~78.46%

> **Note:**  
> The "Resolution" class was underrepresented in the training data due to dataset limitations (only 4 images available).

---

## üöÄ Future Work
- Develop REST API to serve the model (Flask / FastAPI).
- Integrate frontend-backend communication with model predictions.
- Collect more labeled data to improve classification for minority classes.
