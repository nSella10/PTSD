# PTSD Research Tool

A research project focusing on building a machine learning model to predict microglial cell activation in PTSD research, supported by a web application for image upload and analysis.

---

## üîç Project Overview

This project combines two main parts:

- **Deep Learning Model** (CNN):
  - A trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model for classifying individual microglia cells based on their activation status.
  - The model was trained on crops (cell images) extracted via YOLO-based segmentation.
  - Final validation accuracy: ~80.8%

- **Web Application** (Frontend + Backend):
  - Allows researchers to upload datasets of microglia cell images.
  - View past uploaded datasets and results.
  - Export analysis results.
  
In future stages, the web backend will communicate with the trained model's REST API to perform real-time predictions and return JSON results.

## üöÄ Future Work
- Develop REST API to serve the model (Flask / FastAPI).
- Integrate frontend-backend communication with model predictions.
- Collect more labeled data to improve classification for minority classes.
